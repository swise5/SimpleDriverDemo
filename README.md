# SimpleDriverDemo

## Description

This is an agent-based model of the behaviour of delivery drivers delivering parcels from depots to end users. It can be used to explore the effectiveness of different levels of staffing, locations of parking, and routing choices in light of changes to demnad. It has been developed in conjunction with the [Freight Traffic Controller 2050 Project](http://www.ftc2050.com/ "FTC 2050 Project Homepage").

## Installation

The code is developed in Java and makes use of the [MASON Simulation Library](https://github.com/eclab/mason "MASON Simulation Library").  To install, clone the repository.

## Usage

Either run the jar or else compile it yourself. More details coming later.
